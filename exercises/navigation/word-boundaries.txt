# Word Boundary Navigation
# Practice w, W, b, B, e, E, ge, gE motions

GOAL: Master different word movement patterns

EXERCISE 1: Basic word movements (w, b, e)
Practice on this line with mixed punctuation:
hello-world, this_is_a test! How are you? Fine, thanks.

Tasks:
- Move forward by words (w)
- Move backward by words (b) 
- Jump to word endings (e)

EXERCISE 2: WORD movements (W, B, E)
Compare word vs WORD on this line:
file.txt some-data user@email.com /path/to/file $variable_name

Try both w and W to see the difference!

EXERCISE 3: Backward word endings (ge, gE)
Start at the end and practice backward word-end jumps:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog's back

EXERCISE 4: Line navigation (0, ^, $, g_)
Practice on these indented lines:
    function calculateTotal() {
        let sum = 0;
        return sum;
    }

Tasks:
- Jump to column 0: 0
- Jump to first non-blank: ^  
- Jump to line end: $
- Jump to last non-blank: g_
