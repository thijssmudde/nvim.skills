# Character Jump Exercises
# Practice f, F, t, T motions and repetition with ; and ,

GOAL: Practice jumping to specific characters efficiently

EXERCISE 1: Forward character jumps (f)
Navigate to each 'x' character in this line using f:
The fox jumps over the box next to six mixed texts

EXERCISE 2: Backward character jumps (F) 
Start at the end and jump backward to each 'o':
Hello world, how old are you? Don't go too slow now.

EXERCISE 3: Till character jumps (t/T)
Jump to just before/after these brackets using t and T:
function calculate(a, b, c) { return (a + b) * c; }

EXERCISE 4: Repetition with ; and ,
Find all semicolons in this code block using f; then ; to repeat:
let x = 5; let y = 10; let z = x + y; console.log(z);
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { sum += i; total *= 2; }

EXERCISE 5: Mixed practice
Navigate efficiently through this sentence hitting each target:
"Practice makes perfect" - jump to: P, m, p, f, t (use various f/F/t/T)

SOLUTIONS:
Ex1: fx;fx;fx;fx;fx
Ex2: $Fo;Fo;Fo;Fo
Ex3: t(, t), t{, t}
Ex4: f;;;; (then navigate second line)
Ex5: fP, fm, fp, ff, ft
