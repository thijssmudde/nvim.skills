# Visual Selection Advanced Techniques
# Practice gv, o, U and other visual mode enhancements

GOAL: Master advanced visual selection manipulation

EXERCISE 1: Re-selecting (gv)
Practice with this paragraph:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Tasks:
- Select some words visually, then press Escape
- Type some other commands (like moving cursor)
- Press gv to re-select the last visual selection
- Try this with different selection types (v, V, Ctrl+v)

EXERCISE 2: Selection direction (o)
Work with this multi-line selection:
First line of selection
Second line here  
Third line content
Fourth line ending

Tasks:
- Start visual selection from "First" 
- Extend to "ending" on last line
- Press o to jump to the other end of selection
- Extend selection in the opposite direction
- Use o again to toggle back

EXERCISE 3: Case transformation (U, u, ~)
Transform case on this mixed text:
hello WORLD this Is A tEsT cAsE
JavaScript Python HTML CSS
firstName lastName emailAddress

Tasks:
- Visually select words and press U (uppercase)
- Select other words and press u (lowercase)  
- Select mixed case and press ~ (toggle case)
- Try with different selection types

EXERCISE 4: Visual line selection tricks
Practice on this code block:
if (condition) {
    console.log("true");
    processData();
    return result;
} else {
    console.log("false");
    handleError();
    return null;
}

Tasks:
- Use V to select entire lines
- Practice expanding line selection up/down
- Use gv to re-select after operations
- Combine with o to change selection direction

EXERCISE 5: Mixed selection modes
Combine different visual modes on this data:
ID    Name         Email                Phone
001   John Doe     john@email.com      555-1234
002   Jane Smith   jane@email.com      555-5678
003   Bob Johnson  bob@email.com       555-9012

Tasks:
- Start with character selection (v)
- Switch to line selection (V)
- Switch to block selection (Ctrl+v)
- Practice transitioning between modes

EXERCISE 6: Visual selection with text objects
Combine visual mode with text objects:
function calculate(a, b) {
    const result = (a + b) * 2;
    return "Result: " + result;
}

Tasks:
- Start visual selection, then use text objects (viw, vi), vi", etc.)
- Try vip to select paragraph visually
- Combine with o to extend from different ends

PRO TIP: Visual mode + text objects = incredibly powerful selection!
