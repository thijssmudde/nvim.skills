## Development Notes

- This is a skill-building repository with practical exercises for Neovim proficiency
- Each exercise file contains progressive challenges with clear goals and tasks

- No build system required - open files directly in Neovim to practice
- Exercise content focuses on muscle memory development and real-world scenarios
